- Hi, I’m @annamagda
- Pronouns: she/her 
- I'm a political and medical anthropologist with a background in public health.
- I teach at Haverford College, where I run the interdisciplinary <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/health-studies">Health Studies</a> minor.   
- I’m interested in health equity, transit justice, spatial dimensions of belonging, and urban design.  
- I'm an experienced ethnographer and qualitative researcher, with experience designing monitoring and evaluation frameworks and household surveys. My epidemiology and biostatistics knowledge is rusty. I'm interested in quantification, critical data studies, and data ethics.  
- I’m currently learning QGIS and R.  
- I’m looking to collaborate on mixed methods projects that investigate relationships between the social/structural determinants of health, health outcomes and health care access, and lived experiences of place. I'm particularly interested in questions of mobility in relation to urban citizenship and health.
